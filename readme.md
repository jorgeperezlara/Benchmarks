# Benchmarking systems programming languages

After some time learning high-level, garbage collected programming languages, and mostly attracted by Rust, I decided to give a shot to a new breath of programming languages that were meant to replace C/C++. Nowadays, according to their popularity/maturity, the most likely contenders seem to be Rust and Zig.

For all of the four, C, C++, Rust and Zig, I've read claims online about how theoretically each should be the most performant among all:

* **C/C++:** Because of historical unsafety and theoretical performance. While I strongly dislike that the language lacks support for `restrict` in C++ or SIMD by default, the truth is compiler extensions make up for this lackings.
* **Rust:** Easy aliasing, strong type rules and safety measures should make for easier optimizations. Also, many safety checks can be optimized away by the compilers if deemed redundant/unnecessary.
* **Zig:** Strong focus on flexibility, performance and simplicity.

With this in mind, I went on to perform my own benchmark, a simple, recursive loop division that makes little sense as a function itself, but that it's interesting nonetheless.

These are my specs:

```
             .',;::::;,'.                jorgeperezlara@jorgegigabyte

```

Now, these are the results:

```
$ clang++ -stdlib=libstdc++ -O3 c++.cpp -o c++
$ time ./c++ 
The result is 9999999999

```

```
$ rustc -C opt-level=3 rust.rs
$ time ./rust
The result is 9999999999
real    2m3.918s
user    2m3.764s
sys     0m0.002s
```

```
$ zig build-exe zig.zig -target x86_64-linux -O ReleaseSafe --name zig-safe
$ time ./zig-safe
The result is 9999999999

```

```
$ zig build-exe zig.zig -target x86_64-linux -O ReleaseFast --name zig-fast
$ time ./zig-fast
The result is 9999999999

real    1m56.232s
user    1m56.090s

```

```

$ time ./c

real    1m58.715s
user    1m58.543s
sys     0m0.002s
```

I'm very surprised at the excellent performance of safe Zig, which, suppossedly, should be slower than fast Zig (and C++, and Rust).

All in all, I can safely say after several runs, that indeed the Zig version is consistently the most performant (and significantly so for the safe Zig one); and the Rust one slightly **(but consistenly)** less than the C++ one. You may find a summary table below:

|                      | Total time (s) | Deviation from the most performant (s) | Deviation from the most performant (Ã—) |
| :------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **C++**        | 119.102        | 21.029                                 | 1.214                                   |
| **C**          | 118.545        | 20.472                                 | 1.209                                   |
| **Rust**       | 123.766        | 25.693                                 | 1.262                                   |
| **Zig (safe)** | 98.073         | 0.000                                  | 1.000                                   |
| Zig (fast)           | 116.093        | 18.020                                 | 1.184                                   |

~~In my opinion, **for this benchmark**, if anyone believes a 4% decrease in performance for Rust is not significant, I believe it's coherent to say that a 31.3% performance decrease is definitely **not insignificant**, and that Zig is by far the faster among all.~~

~~While the performance differnce between C++ and fast Zig; and C++ and Rust is not too big (in this machine), the difference between fast Zig and Rust is around 6.6%, and this might grow larger in embedded or lower-power systems.~~

## Conclusions

After reading lots of replies, I believe I have reached a very interesting conclusion that the readers might want to read, thanks to [/u/TDplay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1dqyarh/comment/laux15o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):

This is a rather surprising result, so let's take a closer look instead of jumping to conclusions. In particular, let's look at the assembly of the `half` function.

For the sake of brevity, I am stripping the assembly of any comments, unnecessary labels, and debug information. I am also looking
exclusively at the `half` function. If you want to view the generated assembly in full, run the commands which I provide, and open
the assembly files in your favourite text editor.

I am testing this for the x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu target.

C code, compiled `clang -O3 -S c.c -o c.s`

```
half:
	.p2align	4, 0x90
.LBB0_1:
	movq	%rdi, %rax
	shrq	%rdi
	cmpq	$1, %rax
	jg	.LBB0_1
	retq
```

 C++ code, compiled `clang++ -O3 -S c++.cpp -o c++.s`

```
_Z4halfx:
	.p2align	4, 0x90
.LBB0_1:
	movq	%rdi, %rax
	shrq	%rdi
	cmpq	$1, %rax
	jg	.LBB0_1
	retq
```

Rust code, compiled `rustc -O --emit=asm rust.rs`. I have marked the `half` function as `#[inline(never)]` - without this annotation, the Rust compiler will inline the `half` function and not emit any machine code for it.

```
_ZN4rust4half17h3685362d235d10a4E:
	.p2align	4, 0x90
.LBB4_1:
	movq	%rdi, %rax
	shrq	%rdi
	cmpq	$1, %rax
	jg	.LBB4_1
	retq
```

Zig code, compiled `zig build-exe zig.zig -target x86_64-linux -O ReleaseFast -femit-asm=zig.s`. Note that I have modified the call to `half` from `main` to `@call(.never_inline, half, .{result})`  - this is for the same reason as the `#[inline(never)]` annotation in the Rust test.

Note that the Zig compiler has emitted Intel syntax, while all the other compilers emit AT&T syntax.

```
zig.half:
	.p2align	4, 0x90
.LBB10_1:
	mov	rax, rdi
	shr	rdi
	cmp	rax, 1
	jg	.LBB10_1
	ret
```

Zig code, compiled `zig build-exe zig.zig -target x86_64-linux -O ReleaseSafe -femit-asm=zig.s`. I have performed the same modification as above.

```
zig.half:
	.p2align	4, 0x90
.LBB14_1:
	mov	rax, rdi
	shr	rdi
	cmp	rax, 1
	jg	.LBB14_1
	ret
```

As I suspected, the generated machine code is identical.

All of these benchmarks are emitting identical machine code, and therefore the performance is identical. As such, the performance difference you have measured is either statistical deviation or a methodological error.
